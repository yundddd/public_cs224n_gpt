1

O truant muse, what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;



2

My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;
I love not less, though less the show appear.
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming


3

Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,
That, having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument all bare is of more worth


4

To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold


5

Let not my love be called idolatry,
Nor my beloved as an idol show,
Since all alike my songs and praises be


6

When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme


7

Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control,


8

What's in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
What's new to speak, what now to register,


9

O, never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify;
As easy might I from myself depart


10

Alas, 'tis true, I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view,
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,


11

O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide


12

Your love and pity doth th' impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;
For what care I who calls me well or ill,


13

Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,


14

Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,


15

Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Even those that said I could not love you dearer;
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why


16

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds


17

Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,


18

Like as to make our appetites more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge;
As to prevent our maladies unseen


19

What potions have I drunk of siren tears
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,


20

That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow,


21

'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
When not to be receives reproach of being,
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed


22

Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
Full charactered with lasting memory,
Which shall above that idle rank remain


23

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change.
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;


24

If my dear love were but the child of state,
It might for fortune's bastard be unfathered,
As subject to time's love or to time's hate,


25

Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honoring,
Or laid great bases for eternity,


26

O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle hour;
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st


27

In the old age, black was not counted fair,
Or, if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
But now is black beauty's successive heir,


28

How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st


29

Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action; and, till action, lust
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,


30

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;


31

Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
